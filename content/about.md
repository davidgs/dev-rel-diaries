## <span class='text-span'>Who</span> are we?

We are DevRel Professionals just like you. We are passionate about Developer Relations as well as the health and happiness of others. We want to make discussing mental health and wellness ok within DevRel communities so we've started this experiment to do just that.

We're not entirely certain where this will lead, but as a first step we wanted to provide a platform where DevRel professionals can share their stories about Mental Health in DevRel. We hope that this will help others feel more comfortable sharing their own stories and experiences.

This project is carefully and lovingly created and curated by

## <span class='text-span'>What</span> is 'your story'?

Your story, really, is whatever you want it to be. Whatever you've experienced. This site is about *your* lived experience with mental health in DevRel. Some basic ideas:

- Have you experienced a mental health crisis? We'd love to hear about what happened, and how you dealt with it.
- Have you experienced a mental health crisis and *not* dealt with it? We'd love to hear about that too.
- Have you experienced a mental health crisis and dealt with it in a way that you think others could benefit from? We'd love to hear the story around that.
- Have you experienced discrimination, or worked in a low-trust environment because of your mental health issues? Tell us about that, how it affected you, and how you dealt with it.

Really, we are interested in hearing your stories about *any* aspect of mental health, mental wellness, self-care and self-awareness, and how it relates to DevRel. We want to help alleviate the stigma of mental health issues in tech. We hope to show others that it's ok to talk about it, and that they are not alone in their struggles.

You never know the impact your story, your life experience, can have on someone. What to you was a trivial 'aha!' moment, could be a life-changing revelation for someone else.

## <span class='text-span'>How</span> this works

We want to let you share your story.

We want you to feel safe sharing your story.

Once you've done that, you can submit your story. We'll review it, and if it's appropriate, we'll publish it. We'll also share it on our social media channels. [@DevRelDiaries](https://twitter.com/DevRelDiaries) on Twitter.

### How to submit your story

Really, we're trying to make this as easy as possible. Please see the [instructions for submitting your story](/contribute/).


## <span class='text-span'>Words</span> of wisdom

You'll notice on our main page that we have some small items containing "words of wisdom". These are quotes from people who have been kind enough to share their thoughts with us. We hope that you'll find them helpful, and that they'll inspire you to share your story.
