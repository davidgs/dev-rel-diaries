## Who are we?

We are DevRel Professionals just like you. We are passionate about Developer Relations as well as the health and happiness of others. We want to make discussing mental health and wellness ok within DevRel communities so we've started this experiment to do just that.

This project is carefully and lovingly created and curated by

## How this works

We want to let you share your story.

We want you to feel safe sharing your story.

The very **first** thing is to make sure you're aware of, and agree to, our [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct/).

We're tyrng to make it as easy as we can for you to share. If you don't want to be anonymous, you can simply clone the repository for this site at [DevrelDiaries on GitHub](https://github.com/davidgs/dev-rel-diaries), write your story in markdown, and submit a pull request. We'll review it and publish it.

Start a new file in the `content/posts` directory. Name it something like `my-story.md`. Add the following to the top of the file:

```
---
title: "My Story"
date: 2021-07-15
image: /images/whatever.jpg
description: "My story about mental health and wellness"
author: "Sneaky Fox"
---
```
Put your image in the `static/images` directory. Then write your story in markdown.

If you want to be anonymous, you can email your story to [DevRelDiaries](mailto:stories@devreldiaries.com&subject=My%20Story) and we'll publish it for you. It would be *super* helpful if you could write your story in markdown (following the instructions above) and include any images, what pseudonym you'd like to use, etc. as well.

**Note:** We will never publish your email address or any other identifying information without your express consent. We will not share your email address or any other identifying information with anyone else. Ever. Once your story is posted on the site, we will delete your email.

We are looking into an anonymous submission form, but we're not there yet.
